# Wiki

This is a course project where I copy Wikipedia.
You can write articles(and edit them) on any topic using the MarkDown syntaxis and publish them.

The articles save into a folder called entries in an MD file and with the library *markdown* converted them to HTML.

You can go to a random article using the button "random page".

Also, you can add links to another article using the MarkDown syntaxis for links. For example, you are writing an article and want to put a link for the article "Google", you only have to write `[Google](/wiki/Google)`

The project uses Django, HTML and CSS.

You can see all the functions in this [video](https://youtu.be/mrkaD4hFqJw).
